    <h3>Color Correction</h3>
<p>Lighting shifts, camera mismatches, and unbalanced tones can throw off the entire look of your project. My color correction service ensures every shot looks natural, consistent, and clean – the way it should have looked on set. I match skin tones, fix exposure, and maintain visual harmony so your film or photos look effortlessly professional.</p>

    <h3>Color Grade</h3>
    <p>Color is emotion. With expert color grading, I give your project a distinct look and feel that amplifies the story and captures your audience. Whether you want bold and stylized or soft and natural, I craft a unique color palette tailored to your vision. It’s not just grading – it’s mood, tone, and atmosphere brought to life.</p>
